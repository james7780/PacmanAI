Pacman maze AI for competition.

Compile using Visual C++ Express 2010 (or other).


Ideas for AI's:
1. Random AI  (moves randomly)
2. Left/right turning AI (moves forward, turning left or right when available)
3. Minimax AI (weighted decision tree, n moves ahead)
4. Neural network AI (would have to be trained)

The stupid AI's are for testing our "champion" AI against.
